# Virtual-Piano-VHDL
My final project in the subject "Automatic System Desing" (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Facultad de Inform√°tica).
This project implemets a piano keyboard using a VGA-interface to draw the piano keyboard and the notes you are playing. 
This desing generate the sound wave, and make the sum of the notes that you are playing, is a polyphonic keyboard (as much you can listen 4 notes simultaneously). The notes are generated using a resonant IIR filter, configured to resonate at the desired frequency depending on the note that It's being played. To use this desing you need a PS2 keyboard, a VGA monitor and speakers with jack connection.
