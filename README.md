# Virtual-Piano-VHDL
My final project in the subject "Automatic System Desing" (Universidad Complutense, Facultad de Inform√°tica).
This project implemets a piano keyboard using a VGA-interface to draw the keyboard and the notes you are playing. 
This desing generate the sounds, and make the sum of the notes that you are playing, is a polyphonic keyboard (as much you can listen 4 notes simultaneously). To use this desing you need a ps2 keyboard, a vga monitor and speakers with jack connection.
